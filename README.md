# Hospital---Doctor-Records
## Problem Statement:-
```
app consists a form which contain 5 input tags and 1 select tag
Note : HTML tags are already in template.
Form will take
Name of the Doctor
Doctor ID
Specialization (Dermatologist, ENT, Dentist, Gynecologist,COVID) (select tag)
Experience in years
Email address
Mobile Number
On form submit, display this data in form of table (thead is already in place just append to tbody)
Input tags already in template, just finish script part.
Each row should have 8 columns (td)
Name
Doctor ID
Specialization
Experience in years
Email address
Mobile Number
Role
Delete
Role should be given dynamically based on input (make sure role is written in same format, it is case sensitive)
Senior, if experience > 5 years
Junior, if experience is between 2 and 5 years
Trainee, if experience is less than or equal to 1 year
In each row, there should be a delete column and on clicking that delete, that particular row should be deleted.```
